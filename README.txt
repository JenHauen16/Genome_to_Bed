Genomic Nomenclature Conversion to BED file

This Jupyter Notebook is an example script of how to take human hg19 genomic coordinates, get them in the correct format, and then use the hg38 conversions, along with gene name/FISH probe color information, to create a BED formatted file.

The process is documented in the markdown of the Jupyter notebook.
